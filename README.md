Miscellaneous collection of phylogenetic tools I wrote to make life easy


taxo2newick.R - Converts a data frame containing hierarchical taxonomy to a newick phylogeny. Useful for making constraint trees for phylogenetic inference

osgf_to_en.R - Converts British ordnance survey grid references to eastings and northings. Currently only works with 4 digito-alphabet grid reference (e.g., SU96) and finds their centroids.
